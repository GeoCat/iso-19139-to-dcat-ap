# PURPOSE AND USAGE

This XSLT is a proof of concept for the implementation of the suite of specifications concerning the INSPIRE profile of DCAT-AP (INSPIRE+DCAT-AP), available in the collaboration space of the INSPIRE Maintenance and Implementation Group (MIG):
  
https://ies-svn.jrc.ec.europa.eu/projects/metadata/wiki/Alignment_of_INSPIRE_metadata_with_DCAT-AP
    
As such, this XSLT must be considered as unstable, and can be updated any time based on the revisions to the INSPIRE+DCAT-AP specifications and related work in the framework of INSPIRE and the EU ISA Programme, in particular with respect to the work concerning the definition of a geospatial extension to DCAT-AP (GeoDCAT-AP):
