# PURPOSE AND USAGE

This XSLT is a proof of concept for the implementation of the specification concerning the geospatial profile of [DCAT-AP](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/node/63567/) (GeoDCAT-AP), available on Joinup, the collaboration platform of the [EU ISA Programme](http://ec.europa.eu/isa):
  
    https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/node/139283/
    
As such, this XSLT must be considered as unstable, and can be updated any time based on the revisions to the GeoDCAT-AP specifications and related work in the framework of [INSPIRE](http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/) and the EU ISA Programme.

Comments and inquiries should be sent to the GeoDCAT-AP WG mailing list:
