# PURPOSE AND USAGE

This XSLT is a proof of concept for the implementation of the specification concerning the geospatial profile of DCAT-AP (GeoDCAT-AP), available on Joinup, the collaboration platform of the EU ISA Programme:
  
  https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/node/139283/
    
As such, this XSLT must be considered as unstable, and can be updated any time based on the revisions to the GeoDCAT-AP specifications and related work in the framework of INSPIRE and the EU ISA Programme.
